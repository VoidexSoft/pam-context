# Project State: PAM Context

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-19)

**Core value:** Users can ask natural-language questions about their business documents and get accurate, cited answers
**Current focus:** v2.0 Knowledge Graph & Temporal Reasoning — Phase 7

## Current Position

Phase: 7 of 9 (Ingestion Pipeline Extension + Diff Engine)
Plan: 2 of 2 complete
Status: Complete
Last activity: 2026-02-20 — Completed 07-02-PLAN.md (Pipeline Integration + Sync API)

Progress: [##################............] 89% (16/~18 plans across all milestones)

## Milestone Progress

## Accumulated Context

**Decisions:** See PROJECT.md Key Decisions table (11 entries)
- Phase 6-01: graphiti-core 0.28.1 with async classmethod factory pattern for GraphitiService
- Phase 6-01: Entity type fields all Optional with Field(None, description=...) per Graphiti best-effort extraction
- Phase 6-03: Used --legacy-peer-deps for NVL (peer dep on react 18.0.0 exact)
- Phase 6-03: Feature flag VITE_GRAPH_ENABLED for conditional nav rendering
- Phase 6-03: /graph route registered unconditionally for dev convenience
- Phase 6-02: GraphitiService creation wrapped in try/except for graceful degradation
- Phase 6-02: Graph status endpoint returns 200 with status field rather than error HTTP codes
- Phase 7-01: get_episode() for old entity info before removal is best-effort with try/except fallback
- Phase 7-01: Clear segment metadata on rollback regardless of remove_episode success to prevent stale references
- Phase 7-02: Graph extraction is non-blocking: failure sets graph_synced=False without affecting PG/ES data
- Phase 7-02: Old segments retrieved BEFORE save_segments() for chunk-level diff on re-ingestion
- Phase 7-02: MAX_GRAPH_SYNC_RETRIES=3 as constant in ingest routes
**Blockers:** None
**Tech Debt:** 12 items (0 critical) — see `milestones/v1-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`

**Research Notes (v2.0):**
- Research completed with HIGH confidence across all areas
- Phase 7 needs deeper research during planning: Graphiti 0.28 API for episode tombstoning, diff engine query patterns
- Phase 8 needs empirical testing: tool routing degradation after adding graph tool
- Phases 6 and 9 have well-documented patterns, skip research-phase
