## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-19)

**Core value:** Users can ask natural-language questions about their business documents and get accurate, cited answers
**Current focus:** v2.0 Knowledge Graph & Temporal Reasoning — Phase 6

## Current Position

Phase: 6 of 9 (Neo4j + Graphiti Infrastructure)
Plan: — (phase not yet planned)
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-19 — Roadmap created for v2.0 milestone

Progress: [##########....................] 56% (10/~18 plans across all milestones)

## Milestone Progress

| Milestone | Phases | Plans | Status |
|-----------|--------|-------|--------|
| v1 Code Quality Cleanup | 5/5 | 10/10 | Shipped 2026-02-19 |
| v2.0 Knowledge Graph | 0/4 | 0/? | Ready to plan Phase 6 |

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity (v1):**
- Total plans completed: 10
- Total execution time: ~3 days
- Average: ~3 plans/day

## Accumulated Context

**Decisions:** See PROJECT.md Key Decisions table (11 entries)
**Blockers:** None
**Tech Debt:** 12 items (0 critical) — see `milestones/v1-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`

**Research Notes (v2.0):**
- Research completed with HIGH confidence across all areas
- Phase 7 needs deeper research during planning: Graphiti 0.28 API for episode tombstoning, diff engine query patterns
- Phase 8 needs empirical testing: tool routing degradation after adding graph tool
- Phases 6 and 9 have well-documented patterns, skip research-phase
